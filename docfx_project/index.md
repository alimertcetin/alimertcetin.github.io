# About Me

Hi there!

I'm Ali, a 25-year-old game developer and tech enthusiast. I have a strong passion for coding, an interest in AI, a love for music, and a deep passion for gaming.

## Background

I have a background in game development, having worked at a studio for a year. During my time there, I specialized in Data-Oriented Programming and extensively used ECS (Entity Component System). My primary focus was creating hyper-casual game prototypes. I thrive on crafting libraries that can be reused across multiple projects. I'm well-versed in using Unity as my game engine, with a strong command of C# and a dedication to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

## Published Games

I'm proud to have two games published on the Google Play Store:

1. **Idle Kitchen: World Food (2021)**:
   - My first published work on Play Store. This project involved revamping restaurant designs, implementing Google login for user data storage in Firebase, setting up Firebase Analytics, creating a daily reward system, and sending reminder notifications to users. I also integrated localization for four languages and added a leaderboard feature for competition.

2. **Bricks Explosion**:
   - My second published work on Play Store. I collaborated with a friend on this project, with my focus on programming while my friend handled design and store page tasks. Originally inspired by BBTAN, we introduced unique gameplay mechanics. Our main goal for this project was personal growth and skill enhancement, rather than generating income.
